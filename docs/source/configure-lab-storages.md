**How to fill in the form to define a new storage:**

> 1. **Code**. It is advisable to provide a meaningful code for the storage, rather than using the default, because this information is needed when registering storage positions in Batch mode. For example MINUS80\_ROOM\_A1
> 2. **Name**. The name is what is shown in most parts of the ELN. E.g. Minus 80°C in Room A1
> 3. **Number of rows**. This is the number of shelves.
> 4. **Number of columns**. This is the number of racks per shelf.
> 5. **Allowed number of boxes in a rack**. This is the maximum number per rack. Enter a very high number if this is not important.
> 6. **Rack space warning**. Enter space as percentage. E.g. 80, means that the system will give a warning when 80% of a rack is occupied.
> 7. **Box space warning**. Enter space as percentage. E.g. 80, means that the system will give a warning when 80% of a box is occupied.
> 8. **Validation level**. This is the minimum level of information required about the storage:
>     1. **Rack validation**. The position in the shelf and rack needs to be specified.
>     2. **Box validation**. In addition to **a**, a box name needs to be specified.
>     3. **Box position validation**. In addition to **a** and **b**, the position in the box needs to be specified.
