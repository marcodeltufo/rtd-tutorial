Inside one _Project_, a user can register several _Experiments_, which can in turn be divided into single _Experimental Steps._

To register one Experiment:

1. Navigate to the relevant _Project_ in the **Lab Notebook** menu
2. Select **Default Experiment** from the **+New** dropdown, as shown below. _Please note that your openBIS instance might have different types of Experiments, depending on customisation_. 
3. Fill in the relevant fields in the form.
4. Select **Show in project overview** if the _Experiment_ is important and should be shown in the _Project_ form.
5. Click **Save** on top of the form.
