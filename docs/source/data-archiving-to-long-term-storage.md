Data archiving to long term storage must be set up and configured by a system admin as explained inÂ [openBIS Dataset archiving.](https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc1906/Archiving+Datasets)

If this functionality is enabled, users can trigger a request to archive datasets by clicking the archive icon in the dataset form page, as shown below. In the same way, it is possible to prevent certain datasets to be archived.

Please note that a minimum size of 10GB is necessary for long term storage archiving. If the selected datasets are below this threshold, they will be queued and archived only when the threshold is reached.
