If a new _Object type_ for a protocol is created by an _Instance admin_ in the admin interface, it is advisable to set the _Object type_ to **Protocol** in the **Settings**, under **Utilities**.

  
For this, follow the steps below:  
  

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **Edit**
3. Scroll to the last section of the **Settings**: **Object Type definitions Extension**
4. Open the _Object type_ corresponding to your protocol, e.g. **General Protocol**
5. Select **Use as Protocol**
6. **Save**

This is done to be able to create local copies of protocols from the _Inventory_ inside an _Experiment_ when writing _Experimental steps,_ as described inÂ [How to use protocols in Experimental Steps](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/user-documentation/lab-notebook/how-to-use-protocols-in-experimental-steps/)
