## Export Lab Notebooks

  
All levels of the _Lab Notebook_ and _Inventory_ can be exported, using the 2 export options in the **More** drop down, as shown below. It is possible to export metadata only, or metadata and data (only few GBs).

In this way, users can export their complete lab notebook with all data contained in it. Everything is exported to a zip file, which maintains the same structure used in openBIS. Each folder contains several file formats (_.txt, .html, .json, .docx_) with the metadata of the corresponding _Project, Experiment, Object or Dataset_.

  
A link to download the zip file is sent via email to the user. Email notification needs to be configured by a _system admin_ during or after installation, as explained in [Configure Data Store Server](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Installation+and+Administrators+Guide+of+the+openBIS+Data+Store+Server) [.](https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc1906/Installation+and+Administrators+Guide+of+the+openBIS+Data+Store+Server)

Export Builder

  
It is also possible to export the content of the ELN-LIMS using the **Export** **to ZIP** under **Exports** in the **Utilities** main menu.  Here users can select items from different _Spaces_ and export them.
