It is possible to save and re-use searches created in the [Advanced search](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/user-documentation-20-10-3/search/advanced-search/). _Space_ _admin_ rights are required to save searches in a given Space. Searches can be used by anyone with _User_ or _Observer_ rights to a given Space.

In the Advanced Search page, build your search criteria (see example below). To save the search, click the **Save** button and enter:

1. The **Name** of the search
2. The **Experiment/Collection** where the search should be stored

Searches are stored in _Experiments/Collections_.

Saved searches are available from the **load a saved search** drop down menu, at the top of the **Advanced Search** page.
