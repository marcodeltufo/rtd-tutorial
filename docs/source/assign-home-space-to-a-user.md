When a home space is assigned to a user, this becomes marked as **My Space** for that user in the lab notebook, as shown below.

When users are registered via the ELN UI, a _Space_ with their username is created (see [User Registration)](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/user-registration/) and this is automatically set as home space for the user.

The same happens in multi-group instances where spaces are created for each user in the lab notebook section.

An _instance admin_ can change the home space of a user or assign one to a user that does not have a home space assigned from the admin UI, as shown below.

Please note that when a user is inactivated, the home space assigned to that user is moved in the ELN UI to the folder **Others (disabled).** If this is not desired, the space should be removed as home space from the inactivated user. This can be done by an _instance admin_.
