When _Experiments_, _Objects_ and _Datasets_ are deleted, they are moved to the openBIS **trashcan**, under the **Utilities** main menu. Items can be removed from the trashcan only by someone with _Space admin_ or _Instance admin_ role. Deletion from the trashcan is **IRREVERSIBLE**.

Note: _Spaces_ and _Projects_ are directly permanently deleted, they are not moved to the trashcan first.

To empty the whole trashcan, click the blue **Empty Trash** button above the table.

To delete permanently single entries choose one of two options from the Operations dropdown:

- **delete permanently**: deletes permanently only the selected entry.
- **delete permanently (including dependent deletions)**: if the selected entry had children which are also in the trashcan, this option allows to permanently delete both the entry and its children.

If one entity was unintentionally deleted, the operation can be reverted at this stage by choosing the **Revert Deletions** option from the **Operations** drop down in the table.
