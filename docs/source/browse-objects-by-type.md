All Objects of the same type and all Experimental Steps, which may be contained in different Experiments/Collections and Projects, can be browsed using theÂ _Object Browser_ under the _Utilities_ main menu.

This is useful when there are _Objects_ of a certain type stored in different collections (e.g. protocols of the same type stored in two different protocol collections), or to have an overview of all _Experimental Steps_, independently of the _Experiment_ they belong to.
