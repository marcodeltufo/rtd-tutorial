The **Vocabulary browser** is accessible from the **Utilities** main menu. This shows all controlled vocabularies registered in openBIS and the terms they contain. Vocabularies are predefined lists of values to choose from in given fields. Vocabularies can be created/modified by an openBIS _Instance admin_ (see [New Entity Type Registration](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-openbis-19-06-4/new-entity-type-registration/)).

This information is needed for filling the forms for **Batch Upload** or**Batch Update** of _Objects_ via TSV file. If an _Object_ has a property of type _Controlled Vocabulary_, the codes of the vocabulary have to be entered in the .tsv template file. This is not the case for XLS Batch registration or update, where labels can be used.
