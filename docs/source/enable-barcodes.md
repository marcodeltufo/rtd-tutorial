In order to be able to add custom barcodes to _Objects_, an _Instance Admin_ needs to add the $BARCODE property to the object type for which barcodes are needed.

The barcode functionality is disabled by default in the ELN UI. This can be enabled by a _lab manager_ or a _group admin_ with admin right to edit the **Settings**, as shown below.

After enabling the option, please refresh your browser. The **Barcodes Generator** will be shown in the main menu under **Utilities**.
