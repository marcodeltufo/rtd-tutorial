This documentation explains how to customise openBIS ELN-LIMS for specific use cases.

  
Most customisation can be done by a lab manager who should have _Space admin_ role for the Inventory Spaces and the ELN Settings.

  
Some customisation, such as creating _entity_ _types_ and _Spaces_, can only be done by an _Instance admin_. This is always specified in the documentation pages.  
  

Additional documentation for _sys admins_ and _programmers_ about installation, configuration, APIs can be found here: [https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc1906/openBIS+19.6+Documentation](https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc1906/openBIS+19.6+Documentation)
