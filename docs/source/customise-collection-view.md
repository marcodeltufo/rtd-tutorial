It is possible customise the view of _Collections_ in the ELN.

The default _Collection_ can have a **Form View** or a **List View**. Depending on this selection, the collection view will be different.

**Form View:** This shows the metadata of the _Collection_ along with the table of objects. This view is useful when a user wants to see specific metadata for a _Collection_.

**List View:** The metadata of the _Collection_ is not shown in this view, but only the table of objects is shown.

In this case a user would need to click on **More..**, and **Edit** **Collection** in order to see the metadata and be able to edit the _Collection_.
