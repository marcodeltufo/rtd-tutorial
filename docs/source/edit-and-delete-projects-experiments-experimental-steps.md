_Projects_, _Experiments_ and _Experimental Steps_ can be deleted using the **Delete** option under **More** tab in the toolbar

Selected entities are moved to the **trashcan**, from where they need to be removed in order to be permanently deleted from the database.

Please be aware that, by default, only users with _Space Admin and Instance Admin_  role have permission to delete. Default permissions can be modified only by a _system admin_ (see [Changing the openBIS capability role map](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Installation+and+Administrator+Guide+of+the+openBIS+Server#InstallationandAdministratorGuideoftheopenBISServer-ChangingtheCapability-Rolemap))
