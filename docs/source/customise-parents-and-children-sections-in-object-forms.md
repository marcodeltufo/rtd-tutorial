title: "Customise Parents and Children Sections in Object Forms"

The **Parents** and **Children** sections are automatically created in all _Object_ forms. It is possible to customise or remove these sections, from the **Settings**, under **Utilities**.

  
Let's consider an example. The default _Experimental Step_, present in all openBIS instances, looks like the picture below: in the **Parents** section, **General Protocol** is predefined. If we want to add a General Protocol to the form, we use the **Search** or **Paste** options next to General Protocol. If we want to add another parent, for example a **Sample**, we need to use the **Search Any** or **Paste Any** next to Parents. See also [Add parents and children to Experimental Steps.](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/user-documentation-20-10-3/lab-notebook/add-parents-and-children-to-experimental-steps/)

Now let's see how the **Parents** and **Children** sections of an _Experimental Ste_p can be configured in the **Object Types Definition Extension** in the **Settings.**

1. **Section Name**. Enter an alternative name for the **Parents** or  **Children** section. If empty the default is used (Parents/Children).
2. **Disable the section** for the _Object_ type. No parents/children can be added to this _Object_ type.
3. **Disable addition of any object type**. This removes the **+** button next to the section name, which enables to add as parent any _Object_ type. In this way only _Objects_ of types pre-defined in the form can be added.
4. To define which _Object_ types should always be shown in the form of a this _Object_ type, click the **+** button.
5. Select if this is a **Parent** or **Child** from the **drop down**.
6. Enter a **Label**, which is what is shown in the _Object_ form.
7. Select the _Object_ type from the **drop down**.
8. Specify the **minimum** and **maximum** number of parents needed as input for this _Object_ type. This can be left empty if parents are not mandatory for this type. If a minimum is specified, this makes the addition of those parents mandatory. As many parents as specified in the minimum field will have to be added in order to be able to save the form.
9. Specify A**nnotations** (e.g. Comments) for this parent _Object_ type.
10. Click the + button on the section to add an annotation field.
11. Select the **Annotation** field from the list of available fields.
12. Specify if the **Annotation** is mandatory.

  
The figure below shows how the **Annotation** of type **Comments** looks like in the _Experimental Step_ form.
