The default Inventory contains two folders: **Materials** and **Methods**.

These are used to organise respectively samples and materials of any type and lab protocols.

Samples, materials and protocols are modelled in openBIS as **Objects**.

In the **openBIS ELN-LIMS for life sciences**, the following Object types are preconfigured in the database:  
  

_Antibodies, Chemicals, Enzymes, Media, Solutions and Buffers, Plasmids, Plants, Oligos, RNAs, Bacteria, Cell lines, Flies, Yeasts, General protocols, PCR protocols, Western blotting protocols._

These Objects are organised in **Collections** in the **Materials** and **Methods** sections of the Inventory .

The **generic openBIS ELN-LIMS** only has one predefined Object type for the Inventory, _General Protocol,_ in the **General Protocols** Collection in the **Methods** folder. The **Material** folder is empty_._ Additional Object types and Collections must be created by an openBIS instance admin, based on the needs of the lab(s).
