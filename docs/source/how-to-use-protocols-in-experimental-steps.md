When adding protocols to an _Experimental Step_, two options are available:

1. Link to a **Protocol** stored in the _Inventory_. This can be used if the protocol was followed exactly in all steps as described.
2. Create a **local copy of the Protocol** from the _Inventory_ in the current _Experiment_. This should be done if some steps of the main protocol were modified. These modifications can be edited in the local copy of the protocol, while the template is left untouched.

 

To create a local copy under the current Experiment of a template protocol stored in the _Inventory_:

1. Add a protocol as parent.
2. From the **Operations** dropdown in the parents table select **Copy to Experiment.**
3. Provide the **Object code** for the new protocol.
4. A copy of the protocol is created under the current _Experiment_, where the user can modify it. This copy has the original protocol set as parent, so that connection between the two is clear.
