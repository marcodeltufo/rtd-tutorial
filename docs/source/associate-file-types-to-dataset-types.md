It is possible to associate given file types to given _Dataset_ _types_. In this way when a file of this type is uploaded, the _Dataset_ _type_ is automatically selected. This option can be found in **Settings**.

For example, a Jupyter notebook, which has extension **.ipynb** can always be associated with the _Dataset_ _type_ **Analysis Notebook**.

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **Edit**
3. Scroll down to the **Dataset types for filenames** section
4. Enter the file extension (e.g. ipynb) in the **Filename extension** field
5. Select the D**ataset type** with which you always want to associate this file type (e.g. Analysis Notebook)
6. **Save**
