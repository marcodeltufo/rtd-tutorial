openBIS supports archiving of datasets to Strongbox ([https://www.strongboxdata.com/](https://www.strongboxdata.com/)) as described in [Datasets Archiving](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Archiving+Datasets)

 

This needs to be set up and configured by a _system admin_.

 

Archiving can be manually triggered from the ELN interface. By default, the archiving buttons are not shown, and they need to be enabled by an _Instance admin_ or even a _group admin_ in the case of a multi-group instance. This is done in the ELN Settings, as shown below.

In addition, the Unarchiving helper tool should also be enabled in the ELN Settings:
