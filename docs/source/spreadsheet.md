The spreadsheet component needs to be enabled by a _group admin_ or _lab manager_ who can edit the **ELN Settings**, as described here: [Enable Rich Text Editor or Spreadsheet Widgets](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-openbis-19-06-4/new-entity-type-registration/enable-rich-text-editor-or-spreadsheet-widgets/)

The spreadsheet supports some basic Excel functionalities, such as mathematical formulas (e.g. =SUM(A1+A2)).

It is possible to import an openBIS _Object_ into the spreadsheet, with the **import** button, on the spreadsheet itself:

Please note that if the _Object_ is updated in openBIS, it will NOT be automatically updated in the spreadsheet.
