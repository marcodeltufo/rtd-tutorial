## Default roles assigned in ELN

  
When a user is registered via the ELN interface, a _Space_ (folder) with the name of the user is automatically created under the Lab Notebook main menu. The user is also assigned some default roles:

1. _Space admin_ of the _Space_ created for him/her under the notebook.
2. _Space user of_ the Inventory _Spaces_ (MATERIALS, METHODS by default), the STOCK\_CATALOG and the STORAGE _Spaces_.
3. _Space Observer_ of the STOCK\_ORDERS, ELN\_SETTINGS and PUBLICATIONS S_paces_. 

Modification to default rights can be granted by an _Instance admin_ from the _admin UI_, as explained below.

Overview of roles: [https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/user-registration/openbis-roles/ .](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/user-registration/openbis-roles/)
