To modify the value of one or more fields in several _Objects_ simultaneously:

2. From the **Columns** drop down menu in the table, select **Identifier** and the field(s) you want to update, as shown below.

  If you have several entries in the table, and only need to update a few of them, you can filter the table. You can enter the **names** or **codes** in the filter field of the table and use the **OR** option to search. 

4\. Export the **table** choosing the option **Export visible columns with visible rows** from the **Exports and..** drop down menu (see picture below).

DO NOT export the table in plain text for batch update, otherwise all text formatting will be lost on update!

6\. Fill in or modify the fields to update in the exported file.
