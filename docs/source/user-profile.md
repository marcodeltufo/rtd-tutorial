In the User Profile, a user who is logged in into openBIS can find the following information:

 

1. **First Name**
2. **Last Name**
3. **Email**
4. **openBIS session token**
5. **Zenodo API Token** ([Export to Zenodo](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/user-documentation-20-10-3/data-export/export-to-zenodo/))

 

First name, last name and email are automatically filled in when LDAP or SSO are used for authentication.

In case of file-based authentication, this information can be entered here directly from the user.

For file-based authentication, users can also change their password here, from the **Change Password** option under the **More..** dropdown.
