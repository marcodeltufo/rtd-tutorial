Protocols are standard operating procedures (SOPs) used in the lab. If such procedures are in place, they should be organised in folders in the **Methods** Inventory which, by default, is accessible by all lab members.

openBIS provides a **General Protocol** _Object type_ that can be used. If different specific metadata is needed for protocols, new _Object types_ can be created by an _Instance admin_ in the admin UI and the corresponding _Collections_ can be created in the ELN UI.

To register a new **General Protocol** in the General Protocols folder, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **General Protocols** _Collection_ in the **Methods** folder.
2. Click the **\+ New General Protocol** button in the main page.
3. Fill in the relevant fields in the form or choose from available templates.
4. **Save**

## Links to samples, materials, other protocols

When writing a protocol, it is possible to create links to samples, materials or other protocols stored in the _Inventory_. These are parent-child relationships in openBIS.

Everything that is used in the protocol can be added as **Parent** of the protocol itself. This can be done as described fo Experimental Steps: [Add parents and children to Experimental Steps](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/user-documentation-20-10-3/lab-notebook/add-parents-and-children-to-experimental-steps/)
