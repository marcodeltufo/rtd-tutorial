The default Inventory contains two folders: **Materials** and **Methods**.

These are used to organise respectively samples and materials of any type and lab protocols.

Samples, materials and protocols are modelled in openBIS as _Objects_. In the openBIS ELN-LIMS for life sciences, the following Object types are preconfigured in the database:

Antibodies, Chemicals, Enzymes, Media, Solutions and Buffers, Plasmids, Plants, Oligos,   
RNAs, Bacteria, Cell lines, Flies, Yeasts, General protocols, PCR protocols, Western blotting protocols.  

These _Objects_ are organised in _Collections_ in the **Materials** and **Methods** sections of the Inventory .

The generic openBIS ELN-LIMS only has one predefined _Object_ type for the Inventory:

General Protocol 

Additional _Object_ types and the corresponding _Collections_ must be created by the _Instance admin_, based on the needs of the lab.

It is possible to add additional folders in the Inventory, for example for **Equipment** (see **[Create new Inventory Spaces](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-20-10-3/space-management/create-new-inventory-spaces/))**.
