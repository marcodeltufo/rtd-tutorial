Storage positions by default have the following metadata:

1. Storage code
2. Storage rack row
3. Storage rack column
4. Box name
5. Box size
6. Box position
7. User id

 

It is possible to add additional information. This can be done by an _Instance Admin_ by editing the _Object_ Type **STORAGE\_POSITION** in the admin interface (see [New Entity Type Registration](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/new-entity-type-registration/)).
