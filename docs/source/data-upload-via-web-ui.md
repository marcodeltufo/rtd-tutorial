2\. Select the dataset type (e.g. Attachment).

3\. Fill in the relevant fields in the form. It is advisable to always enter a **Name**, because this is shown in the menu. If the name is not provided, the dataset code is shown.

4\. Drag and drop files in the **Files** **Uploader** area or browse for files.

5\. When uploading a zip file, the option to **uncompress before import** will be presented in the form.

6\. **Save.**

**Note for MacOS users:** the default MacOS archiver generates hidden folders that become visible in openBIS upon unarchive. To avoid this there are two options:

1. Zip using  the following command on the command-line: _zip -r  folder-name.zip folder-name  -x “\*.DS\_Store”_
2. Use an external archiver (e.g. Stuffit Deluxe).
