In the default _Experimental Step_ and in the _Entry_, there is a **Parents** section where it is possible to specify links to materials and methods from the _Inventory_ or to any other _Object_, e.g. another _Experimental Step_ or _Entry_.

**Parents** are all samples/materials used in an experimental procedure, standard protocols from the inventory followed in the experimental procedure, the equipment used. It is also possible to set one _Experimental Step/Entry_ as parent of a second _Experimental Step/Entry,_ to keep the connection between the two.

The name of this section and which parents should be shown in the form, is customisable by the _lab manager_ or _group admin_ as described in [Customise Parents and Children Sections in Object Forms](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-openbis-19-06-4/customise-parents-and-children-sections-in-object-forms/)

## Adding a parent of a predefined type in the form

In the screenshot above, **General protocol** is predefined as parent type in the form. We have two options to add a parent of this predefined type:

### **1\. Search**

1. 1. Click on the **Search** button.
    2. Enter the **name** or **code** of the entry you want to add as parent.
    3. Select the entry you want to add from the list presented to you.
    4.  click the **+Add** button.

The parent will be added only when you **save** the entity.

### **2\. Paste**

1. 1. You may copy the identifier of an entry you want to add as parent from a file, or from an advanced search or from another ELN page. You can paste the identifier(s) in the **Paste** text field.
    2. click the **+Add** button

## Adding parent of any available type

If you want to add a parent that is not specified in the _Experimental Step_ form, you can use the **Search Any** or **Paste Any** options next to **Parents.**

### 1\. Search Any

1. Click **Search Any**
2. Select the _Object_ type for which you want to add a parent
3. Search by **code** or **name** as explained above
4. Click the **\+ Add** button

### 2\. Paste Any

There are cases where you may want to add several parents of the same type or also of different types. In this case, we recommend to use the **Advanced Search** to find the entries you want to add. You can select the desired entries from the table and the **Copy Identifiers** button will become visible. You can copy the identifiers and paste them in the **Paste Any** field in the _Experimental Step_ page, as shown below.

## Adding parent via barcodes

If you want to add a parent that is registered in openBIS and has a barcode associated with it by scanning the barcode:

1.Click on the **barcode** icon in the Parents section

2\. A **Barcode Reader** window opens

3\. Scan the barcode of the entry you want to add as parent

4\. Click on the **Add Objects** button

5\. **Close** 

# Removing a parent 

To remove a parent, choose **Remove** from the **Operations** drop down in the parent table, as shown below.

# **Adding and Removing Children**

Children of _Experimental Steps_ are usually derivative _Experimental Steps,_ or products of the _Experimental Step._ As for the **Parents** section, this section can also be customised by a _group admin_ or _lab manager_ in the **ELN Settings** ([Customise Parents and Children Sections in Object Forms)](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-openbis-19-06-4/customise-parents-and-children-sections-in-object-forms/).

The procedure for adding and removing children is the same as explained for parents.

## Children Generator

The **Children Generator** creates a matrix of all the parents entered in the _Experimental Step_, as shown below. Combinations of parents needed to generate children can then be selected by the user. The _Object_ type to assign to the children and the number of replicas need to be specified. The children will then be automatically generated by openBIS upon registration of the _Experimental Step_.
