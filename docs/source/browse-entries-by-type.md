The **Object Browser** under the **Utilities** main menu allows to see all entries of the same type and all _Experimental Steps_, which may be contained in different _Experiments/Collections_ and _Projects_.

This is useful when there are entries of a certain type that belong to different _Collections_ (e.g. protocols of the same type stored in two different protocol collections), or to have an overview of all _Experimental Steps_, independently of the _Experiment_ they belong to.

From the **Object Browser** page, it is also possible to **Batch register** or **Batch update** _Objects_ using an XLS or TSV template.
