_Collections_ are folders used to organise _Objects_ in the **Methods** Inventory. In this case, _Objects_ are protocols.

  
_Collections_ need to be organised in two folders.

  
For example, if we want to create a collection of lab protocols for microscopy and Mass spec, we need to adopt the following steps:

1. Create two _Object types_ called MICROSCOPY\_PROTOCOL and MS\_PROTOCOL. This can only be done by an _Instance admin_, from the admin interface.
2. Register a first folder called Protocols
3. In the **Protocols** folder, register two additional folders called Microscopy Protocols and MS Protocols

  
The steps for the registration of the folders are the same as explained in [Customise Inventory of Materials and Samples](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-inventory-of-materials-and-samples/)
