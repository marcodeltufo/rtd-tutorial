In the most common use-cases, the **Lab Notebook** part of the openBIS ELN-LIMS contains a personal _Space_ (i.e. folder) for each scientist. Within this _Space_, scientists can organise their work using the openBIS _Projects_, _Experiments_ and _Objects_.

  
An openBIS _Experiment_ is defined as a specific scientific question. The individual attempts to answer this question, are _Objects_ of type _Experimental Step_. At this level, the user can create links to _materials_ and _methods_ registered in the Inventory that were used to perform the _Experimental Step_. These are entered as _Parents_ of the _Experimental Step_. All data produced in the _Experimental Step_ and further processed and analysed can be added at this level.

  
It is also possible to organise the Lab Notebook on _Projects_, rather than on personal _Spaces_. This should be configured by an _Instance admin_.
