In the admin UI it is possible to have an overview of all frozen entries in openBIS. Frozen entries can no longer be modified (see [Freeze Entities](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/user-documentation-20-10-3/additional-functionalities/freeze-entities/)).

The table showing the history of freezing can be found under the **Tools** section in the admin UI, as shown below.
