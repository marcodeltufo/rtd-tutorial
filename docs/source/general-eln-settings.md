In a multi-group instance an _Instance admin_ can customise the General ELN Settings.

 

The Settings can be access from the main menu.

The General ELN Settings are the ones that do not belong to any group **(no group)**, as shown below.

The General ELN Settings consist of two parts:

 

1. **Instance Settings**. These settings affect the whole instance, it is not possible to customise them on a group level.
2. **Group Settings**. These settings affect all general _Spaces_ that do not belong to any group defined in the configuration file (see [openBIS set up for multi group instances](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/User+Group+Management+for+Multi-groups+openBIS+Instances)). This is the case, for example, if _Spaces_ are manually created and they do not belong to any group (see [Create new ELN Spaces](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/space-management/create-new-eln-spaces/)).

Spaces that do not belong to any group do not have a group prefix. In the example below **Equipment**, **Materials**, **Methods**, **Publications** do not belong to any group in the Inventory.

and **Horizon**, **Snf** do not belong to any group in the Lab notebook.

# Instance Settings

 

1. **Custom widget**s. This section allows to enable the Rich Text Editor or Spreadsheet component for a given field, as described in [Enable Rich Text Editor or Spreadsheet Widgets;](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/new-entity-type-registration/enable-rich-text-editor-or-spreadsheet-widgets/)
2. **Forced Monospace Font**. This section allows to force the use of monospace font (i.e. fixed width) for selected MULTILINE\_VARCHAR properties. This is useful for example for plasmid sequences.
3. **Dataset types for filenames**. This section allows to associate files with a given extension to a specific dataset type, as described in [Associate File Types to Dataset Types](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/associate-file-types-to-dataset-types/).

 

 

# Group Settings

 

1. **Storages**. In this section the storages for samples to be used in _Spaces_ not belonging to any predefined group (see above), can be created, as described in [Configure Lab Storage;](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-inventory-of-materials-and-samples/configure-lab-storage/)
2. **Templates**. In this section, the templates for a given _Object type_ to be used in _Spaces_ not belonging to any predefined group (see above) can be created, as described in [Create Templates for Objects](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/create-templates-for-objects/);
3. **Object types definition extension**. In this section, it is possible to:
    1. Define if one _Object type_ is a protocol. If an _Object type_ is defined as a protocol, it is possible to create a local copy of it under an Experiment, when linking to it as a parent, as described in [Enable Protocols in Settings;](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-inventory-of-protocols/enable-protocols-in-settings/)
    2. Enable the storage widget for an _Object type,_ as described in [Enable Storage Widget on Sample Forms](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-inventory-of-materials-and-samples/enable-storage-widget-on-sample-forms/)
    3. Define if the _Object type_ should be shown in drop downs, as described in [Enable Objects in dropdowns](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/new-entity-type-registration/enable-objects-in-dropdowns/);
    4. Define if the _Object type_ should be shown in the main menu under the Lab notebook section. By default objects are not shown in the main menu in the Inventory section.
    5. Customise the _Parents_ and _Children_ sections for an _Object type_ as described in [Customise Parents and Children Sections in Object Forms](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-parents-and-children-sections-in-object-forms/);
4. **Inventory Spaces**. It is possible to move _Spaces_ from the Inventory section to the Lab notebook section and vice-versa as described in [Move Spaces between Lab Notebook and Inventory](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/space-management/move-space-between-lab-notebook-and-inventory/)
5. **Main menu**. The main menu for the _Spaces_ that do not belong to any predefined group (see above) can be customised here, as described in [Customise the Main Menu;](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-the-main-menu/)
6. **Miscellaneous**. In this section it is possible to:
    1. Show the dataset archiving buttons in _Spaces_ that do not belong to any predefined group. Please note that this is not available by default, but the infrastructure for [archiving to tapes](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/user-documentation/data-archiving/) (StrongBox/StrongLink) needs to be put in place by a _system admin ([Multi data set archiving](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Multi+data+set+archiving))_.
    2. Hide sections by default in _Spaces_ that not belong to any predefined group. By default some sections in some forms are hidden:
        1. Description in _Spaces_ and _Projects_.
        2. Identification info in _Spaces_, _Projects_, _Experiments_, _Objects_, _Datasets_.

By unchecking this option, these sections will be shown by default.
