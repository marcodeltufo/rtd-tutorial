It is possible to create templates for _Objects_. Templates are useful when one has to register repetitive _Experimental steps_ or _measurements_ where some fields should always be pre-defined.

For each _Object_ type several templates can be created. This can be done by the lab manager, who should have admin rights for editing the **Settings**. It is not necessary to be _Instance admin_ for this. In a multi-group set up, this can be done by the _group admin_.

  
Procedure:  
  

1. Go to the **Settings**, under **Utilities**
2. Scroll down to the **Templates** section
3. From the **New Template** tab select select the _Object type_ for which you want to have a template.
