The default Inventory contains two folders: **Materials** and **Methods**.

These are used to organise respectively samples and materials of any type and lab protocols.

Samples, materials and protocols are modelled in openBIS as **Objects**. In the openBIS ELN-LIMS for life sciences, the following Object types are preconfigured in the database:  
  

_Antibodies, Chemicals, Enzymes, Media, Solutions and Buffers, Plasmids, Plants, Oligos, RNAs, Bacteria, Cell lines, Flies, Yeasts, General protocols, PCR protocols, Western blotting protocols._  

These **Objects** are organised in **Collections** in the **Materials** and **Methods** sections of the Inventory .  
  

The generic openBIS ELN-LIMS only has one predefined Object type for the Inventory, _General Protocol_. Additional Object types and the corresponding Collections must be created by the users, based on their needs.
