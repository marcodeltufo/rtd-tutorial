In this example, we will see how to register one _Object_ of type **Sample** in the **Raw Samples** _Collection._ The same procedure should be followed to register any other _Object_ in other _Collections_.

1. Click on the **Raw Samples** _Collection_ folder in the main menu.
2. Click the **\+ New SampleÂ ** in the main page
3. Fill in the form
4. **Save**

Please not that the _Object type_ shown in the **+New** button (in this case **Sample**), is what is defined as _default object type_ for the _Collection_. If this is missing in the _Collection,_ the button will not be present.

To register a different object type in the Collection:

1. Select **New Object** from the **More** drop down menu (as shown below)
2. Select the relevant _Object type_ from the list _(Sample,_ in this case_)._
3. Fill in the form
4. **Save**
