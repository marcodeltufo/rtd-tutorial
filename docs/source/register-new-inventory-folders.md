The default Inventory contains two folders: **Materials** and **Methods**. These are openBIS _Spaces_.

It is possible to create additional folders by creating new _Spaces_ in the standard openBIS UI. This can only be done by an _Instance admin,_ following these steps:

1. Select **Admin -> Spaces**
2. Click **Add Space** at the bottom of the page
3. Enter the Space **Code**, e.g. **LAB\_EQUIPMENT**

## Set Inventory Spaces

  
When new _Spaces_ are registered, they are automatically displayed under the Lab Notebook part of the ELN main menu.

It is possible to move a new _Space_ to the Inventory, by editing the **Settings** under **Utilities:**

1. Go to the **Inventory Spaces** section in the **Settings** and click the **+** button as shown below.
2. Select an existing _Space_ from the list
3. **Save** the Settings.
4. Refresh the browser.
