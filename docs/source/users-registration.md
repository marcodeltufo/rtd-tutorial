Users can only be added by someone with _Instance admin_ role:

> 1. Go to **User Manager**, under **Utilities**.
> 2. Select **Create User** from the **Operations** drop down. 
> 3. Provide a username and, if using file-based authentication, a password. The password can later be changed by the user.

##   
User roles

  
When a user is registered in this way, a _Space_ (folder) with the name of the user is automatically created under the Lab Notebook main menu. The user registered in this way has _Space admin_ rights in his/her _Space_ and _Space users_ rights for the Inventory Spaces (MATERIALS, METHODS by default). Modification to default rights can be granted by an _Instance admin_ using the standard openBIS UI.

Please note that users cannot be removed from openBIS. Users can only be deactivated, using the standard openBIS UI.
