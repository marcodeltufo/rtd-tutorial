Currently openBIS offers an integration with the **Zenodo** data repository ([https://zenodo.org/).](https://zenodo.org/)

  
This enables data direct data transfer from openBIS to Zenodo. First of all the connection to Zenodo needs to be configured by a _system admin_ in the DSS service.properties (see [How to configure the openBIS DSS)](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Installation+and+Administrators+Guide+of+the+openBIS+Data+Store+Server) If this is configured, a lab manager, who has admin rights for the **Settings,** needs to enable it in the ELN, as explained in [Enable Transfer to Data Repositories](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-openbis-19-06-4/enable-transfer-to-data-repositories/)**.**

##   
Create Zenodo Personal Access Token

  
In order to be able to export data to Zenodo, you need a valid Zenodo account. You also need to create a **personal access token.** This can be done from the **Applications** under **Settings** in Zenodo, as shown below:
