Templates need to be defined by the lab manager in the [**ELN Settings**](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/create-templates-for-objects/). If templates have been created for a given _Experimental Step_, you can choose from the list of available templates by clicking the **Template** button on the _Object_ form, as shown below.  

A template of an _Experimental Step_ is an _Experimental Step_ with pre-filled values. Templates are useful when you need to repeat an _Experimental Step_ with the same parameters several times and you wold like to have default values for those parameters.
