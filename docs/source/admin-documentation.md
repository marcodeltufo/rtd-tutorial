This documentation explains how to customise openBIS for specific use cases.

Most customisation can be done by a lab manager who should have _Space admin_ role for the Inventory Spaces and the ELN Settings.

Some customisation, such as creating _entity_ _types_ and _Spaces_, can only be done by an _Instance admin_. This is always specified in the documentation pages.

Additional documentation for _sys admins_ and _programmers_ about installation, configuration, APIs can be found here: [openBIS documentation](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/openBIS+20.10+Documentation)

The openBIS admin interface can be accessed via a URL of this type: **https://openbis-xxx/openbis/webapp/openbis-ng-ui/**
