openBIS version 20.10.5 provides a new database navigation in the admin UI, as shown below.

This allows to navigate the openBIS hierarchy of _Spaces, Projects, Experiments/Collections, Objects, Datasets_.

The same navigation menu will be used in the ELN UI in an upcoming openBIS version.

 

# Features

 

## Filter

It is possible to filter the menu by code or name of the desired entity.

## Navigation

To navigate the menu, the nodes have to be opened individually.

When you select an entry in the node, the corresponding entry page opens. Please note that at this stage, this is only intended as a preview for the navigation menu and the forms show the information  of the entity in json format.

If you open several entry pages and you switch between them, by default the navigation menu will scroll up or down to the corresponding entry in the menu. If you do not want to have this behaviour, you can turn off the scrolling by selecting the button on the top right corner of the menu, as show in the picture below.

## Sorting

Each level of the hierarchy except for _Spaces_ (_Projects, Collections, Objects, Datasets_) can be sorted separately, using the buttons shown in the pictures below.

By default, the sorting is done by **Code** in alphabetical order. Other options are: sorting by code in reverse alphabetical order; sorting by ascending date; sorting by descending date.
