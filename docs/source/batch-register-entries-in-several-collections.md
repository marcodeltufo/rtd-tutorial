It is possible to batch register _Objects_ that belong to different _Collections_.

This can be done from the **Object Browser** page, under **Utilities**. Two options are available:

 

1. **XLS Batch Register Objects**: batch registration via Excel template file.
2. **Batch Register Objects**: batch registration via .tsv template file.

## XLS Batch Register Objects

 

This option for batch registration is available since openBIS version 20.10.3. It allows to register _Objects_ of different types to multiple _Collections_.

You can select which types you want to register from the list of available types.

You can then download the template that will allow you to register _Objects_ of the selected types to single or multiple _Collections_. The _Space, Project, Collection_ need to be entered in the file. The complete path for _Projects_ and _Collections_ need to be used, as shown in this example file: [SAMPLE-GENERAL-REGISTRATION-EXPERIMENTAL\_STEP-MASS\_MEASUREMENT-SAMPLE-template](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SAMPLE-GENERAL-REGISTRATION-EXPERIMENTAL_STEP-MASS_MEASUREMENT-SAMPLE-template.xlsx)

 

## Batch Register Objects

 

The batch registration via .tsv file allows to batch register only one type of _Object_ at a time. _Objects_ however can be registered to several _Collections_.

This batch upload method is kept for backward compatibility, but it will be phased out.

In this case, if _Objects_ are to be registered to multiple _Collections_, an **identifier** for the _Objects_ needs to be provided, as shown below. This is not the case with the XLS batch registration, where identifiers can be automatically generated by openBIS.
